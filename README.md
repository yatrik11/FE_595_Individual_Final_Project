# FE_595_Individual_Final_Project

Here, I have built a machine learning model for spam email classification, then created an API for this model using Flask.

This API allows to utilize predictive capabilities and explore the dataset through http requests.

Here, I have used Naive Bayes classifier, which is a popular statistical technique for email filtering. It typically uses bag of words features to identify spam emails.
